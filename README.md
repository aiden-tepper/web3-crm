# Web3-CRM - A Blazing Fast, Intuitive Web3-Enabled Customer Relationship Management System

Welcome to Web3-CRM, a web application designed to make customer relationship management as straightforward and efficient as possible. Built with React, Vite, and Convex, and hosted on Vercel, Web3-CRM offers a sleek, user-friendly interface for managing contacts and interactions. Developed during the DeveloperWeek 2024 Hackathon, this project aims to address the common frustrations with existing CRMs by providing a solution that's not only affordable (free and open-source) but also perfectly tailored to intuitive personal use.

Web3-CRM was born out of a desire to dive into the vibrant world of hackathons and to solve a personal challenge: the search for a CRM solution that's both affordable and simple, without sacrificing functionality. My journey began with a clear vision â€“ to create a CRM that seamlessly aligns with my thought processes and operational needs as an early-career software developer. This project not only offered me a platform to showcase my creativity but also served as a valuable learning experience.

Leveraging React and Vite, I embraced the challenge of navigating through an array of React component libraries and build tools, each contributing to the intuitive and responsive design of Web3-CRM. The backend, powered by Convex, was an exciting venture into new territory, providing a robust and scalable solution that exceeded my expectations. Hosting the frontend on Vercel introduced me to the efficiencies of CI/CD workflows, further enhancing my development skills and understanding of modern web application deployment, and containerizing the webapp using Docker was a welcome added challenge and well worth it.

Through Web3-CRM, I've melded my frustrations and aspirations into a tool that stands as a testament to the power of innovation and the endless possibilities of technology. Plus, I can cancel my existing personal CRM subscription and actually use something I built!
